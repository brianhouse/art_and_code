# Artwork Description Guidelines

An artist's description is a short text that accompanies your work and gives the viewer an idea of how it should be should approached. Giving some background information, adding context, revealing your artistic intent, or giving special instructions might all be meaningful purposes this can serve. For this class, the description should be short—something like two or three sentences.

Remember that your artwork should also have a title, which is another way to position how your piece will be understood.

_Note: An "artist statement" is similar, and the term is sometimes used interchangeably. However, an artist statement frequently addresses an artist's practice as a whole, not an individual work._


### Examples

#### Infocom, _Zork_ (1977)

_Zork_ is an interactive text adventure set in the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground. By typing commands into the terminal, the reader charts their own course through the narrative. Like reading, it leaves much to the imagination, but the interactive element enhances the first-person experience.


#### Liat Berdugo, _Internet Aerobics_ (2018)

Put on your sweatband and come learn some new moves as part of _Internet Aerobics_. After all, everyday that we go online, we send packets of information across internet superhighways through layers of infrastructure: wifi networks, routers, data centers, internet cables, and more. Why not embody this infrastructure ourselves?


#### Jonah Brucker-Cohen, _Crank the Web_ (2001)

_Crank the Web_ is a browser that allows people to physically crank
their bandwidth in order to see a website. Simply enter a URL, start cranking, and text and images appear in the browser window. It is up to you to physically crank your bandwidth so that your internet connection will rely on your personal strength, not personal wealth.
