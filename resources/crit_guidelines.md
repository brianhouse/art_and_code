# Guidelines for Critique

Crit is an opportunity to get collective feedback on your work from your peers and for our class community to develop a shared vocabulary for talking about digital media art. While it can be a vulnerable experience to present your work in front of everyone, this is ultimately a more valuable method of evaluating art—which always exists in dialogue with others—than simply having your work graded by the instructor.

### Presenting
- State your title and read your description
- Give details about your process only if they are important to understanding the result
- If you want, guide the feedback by asking a question of the group
- Don't give caveats about what you would or would not have done if you had had more time, if the computer hadn't crashed, if you were better at math, etc etc

### Critiquing
- Just describe what you see! For example, what is the first thing you notice about the work? How do its parts relate to one another? What is surprising about it? Or even, what effect does the work have on you? Comments like these help the artist learn what is coming across in what they have done, which may or may not match with their intentions
- Don't make statements that start with "I like..."
