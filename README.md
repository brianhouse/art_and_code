## Course Description
Introduction to computer programming for studio artists. By writing code to generate text and graphics, students will explore the qualities intrinsic to artistic expression with computers such as nonlinearity, indeterminacy, glitch, and emergence. Accompanying critical discussion will consider key practitioners in the field. Through progressive weekly projects, students will gain a foundation for working with code in art. Designed for students with little to no programming experience.


#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think abstractly in terms of algorithms
- Understand the underlying structures of contemporary digital tools
- Survey contemporary artists working formally with code
- Build a foundation for expanding into other areas of media art practice
- Gain proficiency programming in the Python programming language


## Assignments and Grading

### Sketches
This course is built around open-ended code "sketches" that progress through a series of formal qualities associated with computational media: **algorithm**, **coordinates**, **repetition**, **indeterminacy**, **nonlinearity**, **recombination**, **glitch**, **emergence**, and **interface**. In addition, each sketch introduces and makes use of a new programming topic, such as the use of loops. We will work on sketches during class, but it is expected that most of your development will be done as homework.

Sketches cumulatively account for 75% of your final grade. They must include a title and a [3-sentence statement](https://github.com/brianhouse/art_and_code/blob/master/resources/statement_guidelines.md) and will be [critiqued](https://github.com/brianhouse/art_and_code/blob/master/resources/crit_guidelines.md) during class. All work must be submit online through Moodle *prior* to the crit—**no late work is accepted**, and you must attend the crit for your work to be graded. Submit your sketch folder with an image or text output and type your statement on Moodle (keep a copy to present with during crit). Sketches will be evaluated on both craft and concept.

### Presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an artist working with code. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show one or two artworks in detail. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. The presentation should end with a couple of questions posed to the class for discussion that relate to the technique or themes of the artist's work. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1stVk6uRyHTKgFqAxmZ_sBF8zGIjWaTkDUbEUssZV3kk/edit?usp=sharing) on an artist chosen from [a list](https://github.com/brianhouse/art_and_code/blob/master/resources/artists.md) on a first-come, first-served basis. These presentations make up 10% of your final grade.

### Participation
Motivated and mindful participation in crit and classroom disscussion is expected and constitutes 15% of your final grade. Attendance is mandatory, and missed classes or late arrivals will impact your participation grade at the professor's discretion. 


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Laptop Use
This course requires a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, you will need to make arrangements to borrow one for the course.

<!-- ### Open Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours.
 -->
### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways computation capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
