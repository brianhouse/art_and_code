Office hours W 3:15–4:45


## Course Description
Introduction to the form and aesthetics of digital media. By writing code to generate graphics and text, students will explore the qualities intrinsic to artistic expression with computers such as nonlinearity, indeterminacy, and emergence. Accompanying critical discussion will consider key practitioners in the field. Through progressive weekly projects, students will gain a foundation for working with code in art. Designed for students with little to no programming experience.


#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think abstractly in terms of algorithms
- Understand the underlying structures of contemporary digital tools
- Survey contemporary artists working formally with code and digital media
- Build a foundation for expanding into other areas of media art practice
- Gain proficiency programming in the Python programming language


## Assignments and Grading

### Sketches
This course is built around open-ended code "sketches" that progress through a series of formal qualities associated with digital media: **algorithm**, **coordinates**, **repetition**, **indeterminacy**, **nonlinearity**, **recombination**, **glitch**, **emergence**, and **interface**. In addition, each sketch introduces and makes use of a new programming topic, such as the use of loops. We will work on sketches during class, but it is expected that most of your development will be done as homework.

Sketches cumulatively account for 80% of your final grade. They must include a title and a [3-sentence description](resources/description_guidelines.md) and will be [critiqued](resources/crit_guidelines.md) during class. All work must be submit online through [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/NDA5NzQ5Njc5ODk4) *prior* to the crit—no late work is accepted, and you must attend the crit for your work to be graded. Submit your .pyde file, an image file (if relevant), and a Google doc with your description. Sketches will be evaluated on both craft and concept.

### Survey presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an artist working in digital media. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show one or two artworks in detail. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. The presentation should end with a couple of questions posed to the class for discussion that relate to the technique or themes of the artist's work. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nggDB1bS2JwEHQEd68H1AvLbPs22qDmSZV5r_P9cJYI/edit#gid=0) on an artist chosen from [a list](resources/digital_media_artists.md) on a first-come, first-served basis. These presentations make up 10% of your final grade.

### Unit introductions
At the beginning of each unit, there is a (very short) introduction to read; responses to this reading on classroom constitute 10% of your final grade.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Laptop Use
This course requires a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, you will need to make arrangements to borrow one for the course.

### Open Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fields 205 outside of class hours.

### Course Fee
There is a course fee automatically paid through student accounts when registered for this class. The fee helps cover software licensing and sensor hardware. However, open source software will be used whenever possible.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7192). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.  

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College's 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. The work submitted in Digital Media courses must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
The Fields Art Center is built on land belonging to the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watalala bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya, and other indigenous nations of the Columbia River, and we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. Furthermore, we are at an institution named after white colonizers in a city with a racist history. As artists working in Digital Media, we must be aware of and resist the many ways computation capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.

### COVID Health and Safety Expectations

The College’s health and safety guidelines are applied in all settings across campus and comply with county guidelines. We each share responsibility to keep our community healthy by adhering to the following expectations:

Wear a face covering when inside, even when physical distancing can be maintained, and outside when physical distancing cannot be maintained.
Stay at home if you have any of the following COVID symptoms, including cough, fever or chills, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, nasal congestion, or runny nose.
The Art Department reserves the right to ask you to leave the studios if you exhibit symptoms. If you are present in the studios without a mask, we will remind you to put on a mask immediately or leave class. If necessary, masks may be removed for a short duration for drinking, but please minimize these temporary removals and do not consume food during class time.

If you are experiencing COVID symptoms DO NOT come to campus. Information on COVID symptoms can be found on the LC Health and Safety Expectations webpage and on the CDC webpage.
