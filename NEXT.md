## nonlinearity
- make them make a toy example with three rooms and be strict about that so they don't immediately go off the deep end
- maybe outlaw "house" and fantasy adventure as themes, to break from Zork
- make them put title and description in the code itself
- spend more time on concept, has to be instruction about good gameplay or narrative for those to be meaningful grading points
    art: form matches content (maze of feelings, for example)
    game: what are the stakes?
    worldbuilding:
    immersion: meaningful choices
    maybe add additional "lecture": "On world-building", etc
    also aesthetics of the text
- map -> flowchart or diagram, otherwise they make a literal map
- have a whole section on text formatting
- have two rounds of playtesting
- have them present a concept in advance and have it critiqued
- the results were really too mechanical
- basically, get a lot more out of this assignment in terms of content and _design_--the code worked
- (also include "random" in there, which requires a different kind of import statement)
- this is such an absolute beast to grade (especially with two sections)

## recombination

have them do it first with scissors and paper?



## emergence

more for content on complex systems is here: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/

global function to turn on gravity

examples are a pin ball machine and the current shark thing

code reference with all the possibilities

agent.can_collide(other_agent)
agent.can_collide(list_of_agents)
agent.can_collide(a_wall)
agent.can_collide(list_of_walls)



### general

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form
/

- still missing map(), seems significant
