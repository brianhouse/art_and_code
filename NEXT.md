## Organization

SMALL GROUP DESK CRITS once the tables support it


## Units

am I consistent with the use of "argument"?


### coordinates

width and height (and math with them)



### repetition

context: Walter Benjamin, Harold Cohen, NFTs, Steve Reich (micro effects emerge)

map and range parameters

op art -- more visual examplesa

coolers site for color schemes


### indeterminacy
rotation example

better prompt


### recombination
have them do it first with scissors and paper?
more examples from students so they know the possibilities


### emergence

avoiding edges works poorly

code reference with all the possibilities

agent.collide(other_agent)
agent.collide(list_of_agents)
agent.collide(a_wall)
agent.collide(list_of_walls)

integrate step cycle into objects and argument

conditionals
animation
walls
time


need to have a "proposal" step where they come up with something

agents -> agent_list or all_agents
that's been a source of confusion

need a diagram for how to "draw" in the draw_agent functions

use bat.size


### general

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form
/

- still missing map(), seems significant


### future

Where is Art+Code going? IF broken out can be replaced with screen saver with if-then statements based on the timer. could potentially do that now. recombination could be visual text. and then there's room to bring in interface. it's a little more cohesive. what of this can I do now?
