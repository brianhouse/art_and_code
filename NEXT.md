## Units

### coordinates
- bezier is impossible. need to show beginShape and curveVertex and have a mini-assignment on it
- definitely have beginShape endShape, also with regular shapes. the writing a letter thing was good

## indeterminacy
- not sure about the three versions thing. in some ways it worked, in some ways not, would have to emphasize that more. texture is a bit better
- might want to put the nature prompt back in?
- show how to draw a "soft line" with a loop of very random points over a very narrow band
- conceptual is really that randomness should play a role in the concept in some way

## glitch

### general

- emphasize title and descriptionâ€”have them read it, and make sure it's good

- add the new examples, natch!

/

- still missing map(), seems significant
