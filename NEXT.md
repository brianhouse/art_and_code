## Organization

## Units

### coordinates
- bezier is impossible. need to show beginShape and curveVertex and have a mini-assignment on it
- definitely have beginShape endShape, also with regular shapes. the writing a letter thing was good
- had too much time, but that was because of labor time and canceled class

## indeterminacy
- not sure about the three versions thing. in some ways it worked, in some ways not, would have to emphasize that more. texture is a bit better
- might want to put the nature prompt back in?
- show how to draw a "soft line" with a loop of very random points over a very narrow band
- conceptual is really that randomness should play a role in the concept in some way

## nonlinearity
- make them make a toy example with three rooms and be strict about that so they don't immediately go off the deep end
- maybe outlaw "house" and fantasy adventure as themes, to break from Zork
- make them put title and description in the code itself
- spend more time on concept, has to be instruction about good gameplay or narrative for those to be meaningful grading points
    art: form matches content (maze of feelings, for example)
    game: what are the stakes?
    worldbuilding:
    immersion: meaningful choices
    maybe add additional "lecture": "On world-building", etc
    also aesthetics of the text
- map -> flowchart or diagram, otherwise they make a literal map
- have a whole section on text formatting
- have two rounds of playtesting
- have them present a concept in advance and have it critiqued
- the results were really too mechanical
- basically, get a lot more out of this assignment in terms of content and _design_--the code worked
- (also include "random" in there, which requires a different kind of import statement)
- this is such an absolute beast to grade (especially with two sections)

## recombination
/
sources:
books
wikipedia articles
transcribed audio
legal texts / laws / contracts
movies: scripts, closed-captioning
lyrics
newspaper articles
social media feeds

have them do it first with scissors and paper?

## glitch
Emphasize the error in transmission between source and result
use `source` as a variable in the code


### general

- emphasize title and descriptionâ€”have them read it (and say nothing else?), and make sure it's good (synonymous with concept?)

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form

- add the new examples, natch!

- artist presentations -> survey presentations

- lectures are stumbling vs the notes. slides would be better.

- this should increasingly be about the _quality_ not the code. maybe this is a matter of adding a "design considerations" section after code or in each assignment

/

- still missing map(), seems significant

//

Separate "Context", "Code", and "Concept" documents for each one? Concept being the design considerations to take into account when coming up with a concept and matching it to form?

### idea

eliminate recursion and recombination
move glitch before NN
then focus on simulation, with some mini list assignment first
this assumes simulation works well
alternately, really cut down recombination so it's not so much stupid syntax stuff:
load(text)
get_words(s)
get_sentences(s)
remove_punctuation(s)

examples:
sentence cut ups
interleave
find replace
sort analysis
free verse
madlibs


2D:
- coordinates
- repetition
- indeterminacy
- glitch

text:
- recombination / cut-ups, but make it simple
- narrative (use inventory)

simulation
