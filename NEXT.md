## Organization

## Units

Have explicit conceptual prompts each assignment. Must fulfill the tech thing (use a loop) and the conceptual aspect (sense of complexity... or whatever)


## repetition
add lovid

## recombination
have them do it first with scissors and paper?
more examples from students so they know the possibilities


## emergence

more for content on complex systems is here: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/

global function to turn on gravity

examples are a pin ball machine and the current shark thing

code reference with all the possibilities

agent.can_collide(other_agent)
agent.can_collide(list_of_agents)
agent.can_collide(a_wall)
agent.can_collide(list_of_walls)



### general

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form
/

- still missing map(), seems significant
