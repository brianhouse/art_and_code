ran out of time for emergence â€” use the final exam for the final project

### interface

cover quantization

no one used random -- am I losing them?


### nonlinearity

room -> scene

a message that comes up and goes away?


models of branching:
straight branching
total rooms
carrying things

elapsed -> has_elapsed
change_frame -> frame_changed, and make it accessible


### emergence

make .move() implicit?
add a function to move() to a given location ?
make a "rotate" property in the agent to adjust for drawing wrong

bounce vs wrap

note the need to have collides written first for wall visibility

- more background about what emergence is and the possibilities 

make the seek etc work with "cursor" or something



### format

the code lectures work well, I think I stick with my format

the context ones should be as discussion based as possible, could actually make sense to have slides
- just image slides
- bullet point concept slides

use HTML as an intermediate format, then I can style with css and outputs a pdf

just image with caption
for vids, straight link to github online
