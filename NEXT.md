## Organization

## Units

### coordinates
- bezier is impossible. need to show beginShape and curveVertex and have a mini-assignment on it
- definitely have beginShape endShape, also with regular shapes. the writing a letter thing was good
- had too much time, but that was because of labor time and canceled class

## indeterminacy
- not sure about the three versions thing. in some ways it worked, in some ways not, would have to emphasize that more. texture is a bit better
- might want to put the nature prompt back in?
- show how to draw a "soft line" with a loop of very random points over a very narrow band
- conceptual is really that randomness should play a role in the concept in some way

## nonlinearity
- make them make a toy example with three rooms and be strict about that so they don't immediately go off the deep end
- maybe outlaw "house" and fantasy adventure as themes, to break from Zork
- make them put title and description in the code itself
- spend more time on concept, has to be instruction about good gameplay or narrative for those to be meaningful grading points
    art: form matches content (maze of feelings, for example)
    game: what are the stakes?
    worldbuilding:
    immersion: meaningful choices
    maybe add additional "lecture": "On world-building", etc
    also aesthetics of the text
- map -> flowchart
- have a whole section on formatting
- have two rounds of playtesting
- have them present a concept in advance and have it critiqued
- the results were really too mechanical
- basically, get a lot more out of this assignment

## recombination
- it's a bit much. I think I may need to have prewritten code for setting things up. even like "filter_stop_words(words)" or "get_verbs(words)" so it's all functions and not methods
- then teach a set of fundamental operations that involve lists: sort, replace, combine, loops, etc. That part is good.
- examples are weak
- possibly eliminate this
/
- make zine or poetry reading?



## glitch

### general

- emphasize title and descriptionâ€”have them read it (and say nothing else?), and make sure it's good (synonymous with concept?)

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form

- add the new examples, natch!

- artist presentations -> survey presentations

- lectures are stumbling vs the notes. slides would be better.

/

- still missing map(), seems significant


### idea

eliminate recursion and recombination
move glitch before NN
then focus on simulation, with some mini list assignment first
this assumes simulation works well
alternately, really cut down recombination so it's not so much stupid syntax stuff:
load(text)
get_words(s)
get_sentences(s)
remove_punctuation(s)

examples:
sentence cut ups
interleave
find replace
sort analysis
free verse
madlibs


2D:
- coordinates
- repetition
- indeterminacy
- glitch

text:
- recombination / cut-ups, but make it simple
- narrative (use inventory)

simulation
