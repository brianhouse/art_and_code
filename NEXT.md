## Organization

SMALL GROUP DESK CRITS once the tables support it


## Units

am I consistent with the use of "argument"?


### coordinates

width and height (and math with them)
...and then use that throughout the examples


### repetition

context: Walter Benjamin, Harold Cohen, NFTs, Steve Reich (micro effects emerge)

range parameters

op art -- more visual examplesa

coolers site for color schemes


### indeterminacy

better prompt

more gaussian

noise?


### nonlinear narrative

everyone has to be on the same version of python


### glitch

explicitly talk about variables

cd skips
circuit bending
tv snow and vcr
examples of how it's entered the vernacular

/

threshold example
sections example
shatter example




### conditional / screensaver / nonlinearity?

transformations?
more on mapping



### recombination
have them do it first with scissors and paper?
more examples from students so they know the possibilities


### emergence

make .move() implicit?
add a function to move() to a given location ?
make a "rotate" property in the agent to adjust for drawing wrong

bounce vs wrap


note the need to have collides written first for wall visibility

- more background about what emergence is and the possibilities 


### interface

fill bucket using pixels

is this before or after time? maybe before


pMouse

agents

buttons that show if they are selected

drippy brush using agents (if after emergence)

using pgraphics could potentially avoid the painting over thing

fill bucket builds off of glitch?

bearing between mouse and pmouse 

circular buttons

have proper speed is important

need to use mouseReleased instead of mouseClicked



### general

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form

from students:
- open lab time peer time (maybe online?)
- publicly accessible code



I feel like interface can go earlier. even before time.
coordinates -> repetition/indeterminacy -> glitch -> interface -> time -> emergence -> final


this sets up an interesting dynamic where time and emergence could have interface elements from the get go

nonlinearity. no way to make it work the same way within processing. but. if we have interface first, there's some options. Myst style!

or maybe nonlinearity, lists, and text could all be combined?
ie, multiple choice

ok, so I love Zork, but this could be even better. and they get to play Myst.

really need to have the context lectures in actual lecture format, there's a disconnect where it's not flowing for me




### future

Where is Art+Code going? IF broken out can be replaced with screen saver with if-then statements based on the timer. could potentially do that now. recombination could be visual text. and then there's room to bring in interface. it's a little more cohesive. what of this can I do now?

glitch becomes the introduction to variables

this time, replace recombination with a screensaver module

//

the conceptual components to the assignments need to be stronger maybe to make it feel like im doing a substantive thing 

losing “Digital Media” as a purpose was clarifying for the presentation of the course, but not for the content, the lectures seem like an add on, and taking out IF trivializes everything a bit--then it's just a creative coding course. which is fine?

why would I take out the best unit? to make it it's own thing. but do I want to do that? if I'm switching to sound, maybe the answer is no. ok, but we still don't need to keep recombination, and that really should be visual anyway.

so actually it would make more sense to do visual recombination now. that's the thing. except that feels like a lot of work than screensaver.

what is the conceptual content to screensaver? well, time. and this really sets up emergence better.

the reason for taking out IF is I don't have content for it beyond the game stuff. that's the reason for the co-teach.

ok, so whatever. teach something. do screensaver. swap with glitch.

/

so now with screensaver/time in and interface in too, next step would be to replace IF with screen-based recombination (and put it after glitch), or just keep it. can decide next time.

could there be prompt based drawing in processing? like, draw a circle or a square?
thinking of how to cover ifs and functions without doing the IF unit. maybe it's just animation.

OR I cut glitch. it can't be built upon.

emergence is awesome and I want to spend more time on it
interface is awesome, too, I think
animation really kind of worked

if a text-oriented one can be shorter than IF, that works.
would that come after animation?


repetition and variation -- combine it
eliminate IF, keep the rest as is
add a final project
forget text
