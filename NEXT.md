Do small group screen sharing for intermediate feedback

## Organization

- have a rubric for the presentations also


## Units

### coordinates
- bezier is impossible. need to show beginShape and curveVertex and have a mini-assignment on it
- definitely have beginShape endShape



### Interface

a perceptual explanation of framerate etc seems useful -- animation, human perception

how the hell are they going to try each other's interfaces?

a text example, a la maeda, and add text functions to cheat sheet

lerpColor

use mouseReleased
rather than mouseClicked

all their buttons were terrible, so we need a better example of button interfaces (maybe Audrey's instrument from the first addition)

[
focus on the brushes as much as possible.

the internal variable is confusing. switch it to a number. mode = 4
]

focuses on mouse interaction rather than buttons. duet.

### Emergence

exercise:
wrap and bounce
emergence is get() pixel based


###

missing map

apparently globals can be declared inside setup. that makes a big difference for clarity.


## General

Maybe there is an "elaboration" section for each of these. So for nonlinearity, it's using variables to carry objects.

functions that return things

have the cheat sheet link to sections in the tutorials

I want it to click in terms of programming, but have to be ok if it doesn't for everyone. but the problem-solving aspect should be a part of it, that's what's missing for them, the mentality of making it work.

table crits where I give actual individual feedback, just not in front of the room

for each assignment, there is a problem-solving aspect.

#####

was using "parameters" instead of "arguments", but abandoned that, so could redit for consistency
