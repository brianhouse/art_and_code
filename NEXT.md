## Organization

MORE SMALL GROUP DESK CRITS


## Units


### repetition
context: Walter Benjamin, Harold Cohen, NFTs

map and range parameters


### recombination
have them do it first with scissors and paper?
more examples from students so they know the possibilities


### emergence

avoiding edges works poorly

code reference with all the possibilities

agent.collide(other_agent)
agent.collide(list_of_agents)
agent.collide(a_wall)
agent.collide(list_of_walls)

integrate step cycle into objects and argument

conditionals
animation
walls
time


need to have a "proposal" step where they come up with something

agents -> agent_list or all_agents
that's been a source of confusion

need a diagram for how to "draw" in the draw_agent functions

use bat.size


### general

- emphasize that the goal is to match concept and form
/

- still missing map(), seems significant
