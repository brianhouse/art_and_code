### interface
cover quantization
no one used random -- am I losing them?


### nonlinearity
models of branching:
straight branching
total rooms
carrying things


### emergence

make .move() implicit?
add a function to move() to a given location ?
make a "rotate" property in the agent to adjust for drawing wrong

bounce vs wrap

note the need to have collides written first for wall visibility

- more background about what emergence is and the possibilities 

make the seek etc work with "cursor" or something
