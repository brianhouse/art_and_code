# TODO


## logistics

Students put their work up on the shared folder on Google Drive. Then I just go in to the folder and open the output image. And then they can see what each other did. I leave feedback on Moodle. 

- establish open studio work times (2 times in the week)




## planning

- Portfolio assignment
- difference and repetition assignment
- how to make comments in code for the statement -- put that in getting started
- plan midterm feedback meetings
- content: emergence, nonlinearity, time ... there's a lot

- include pixelDensity(2)

/

- keys / access to 303 and policies
- get an intern

/

am I doing prints?

Time and Emergence can be displayed

need a video game kiosk for nonlinearity. Zac could do this. can it run on a pi? need to buy one. wait for the 5, right? I have 4s to test with.


## flow
coordinates: basic drawing (need width/height)
rep+var: loops and random and i
time: events, frameCount, change and swing
interface: if! mouse, variable to keep track of brush
nonlinear: images, advanced variables, text, state
emergence: objects, lists (data structures)


## content
get Myst working and transferrable?
- multiple platforms

repetition / variation assignment
