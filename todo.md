## Classroom issues
Basically, how am I going to do crit? If I lump both sections, that's great, but I need to somehow have images and descriptions ready to go. and also be able to show the code so people learn.

Do they come up to present? That slows things down, and also raises the issue of them touching my laptop, which I'm really not down with anymore.

ok, so fuck it. use Preview to open all files in the "Context" folder (make sure those files are viewable in Preview), and then I can step through in multiple display mode.

for code, how do I do it? I still need my notes. so I'll have to see the screen.
