google drive set up


MOODLE:
- plan midterm feedback meetings
- keys / access to 303 and policies


CODE:
- emergence
- SimCity emulator (https://dos.zone/sim-city-2000-1993/)
- MYST


## logistics

Students put their work up on the shared folder on Google Drive. Then I just go in to the folder and open the output image. And then they can see what each other did. I leave feedback on Moodle. 

Establish open studio work times (2 times in the week)

Are we ready with Google Drive for Desktop?


## flow
coordinates: basic drawing (need width/height)
rep+var: loops and random and i
time: events, frameCount, change and swing, if
interface: if, mouse, variable to keep track of brush
nonlinear: images, advanced variables (and lists?), text, state
emergence: objects, lists (data structures)


## content
