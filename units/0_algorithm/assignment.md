# Algorithm

Make a drawing. Keep it simple and take only two minutes to do it. It can be abstract or figurative.

Now write step by step instructions (a "score") that when followed will result in this drawing. If it's a representational drawing, describe how to draw it, but don't say what it is.

Give the instructions to someone else and have them follow them to make a new drawing.

Display the two drawings together.
