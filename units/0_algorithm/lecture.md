## Hello

**Take 2min and make a drawing, keep it simple, it can be figurative or abstract, and then set it aside.**


Let's go around and see who's here: name/pronouns + year + major


## Intro

Welcome to Art + Code

So, in this course, what we are going to do is to make art by learning to program a computer.

In the computer science department, you learn to program by solving problems having to do with math and engineering. Here, the problem is how to express yourselves by telling the computer what to do (and ultimately learning from the computer what might be interesting to express).

That's what a program is—an organized set of instructions given to the computer to produce some outcome. There's also a fancy (and much older) word we also use for that (what is it?): **algorithm**.

Are algorithms always on the computer? What are other examples besides code? *[musical score, blueprints, IKEA, Puzzle (emph process), DNA, Legos...]*

A recipe is really a beautiful example of an algorithm, and it's a lot like a computer program. You have a set of specialized terms, like "tablespoon" and "mince", and it involves all kinds of technological equipment.

How do you come up with a recipe?
- experimentation, trial-and-error
- cookbook
- family recipes
- remixing

That's exactly how I want you to think about programming. You're always borrowing _code_—ie, the pieces of a program—using libraries, looking stuff up, and it's lots and lots and lots of trial and error.

Why learn code and not software like Photoshop, Procreate, Unity, After Effects, Blender, etc? Well, if this class was about getting directly to a particular kind of result, and mastering that, perhaps learning software would be a better approach. But our goal isn't to produce flashy stuff, it's to understand the principles behind code and computers as a medium. And in doing that, we'll understand the principles behind these software programs that other people have made for us, and we're also empowered to make our own versions of software. Maybe a drawing program that I make won't be as advanced as one I can buy. But I can make it singularly mine, it can work the way I think, and that can serve practical, critical, and conceptual purposes.


So where does that get us? What's possible with programming? Here are some more or less random examples of artists making things out of code:

- [Sougwen Chung](context/5_sougwen_chung_drawing_operations.mp4)

What do you think about these examples?

How about this one?
- [Sol Lewitt](https://www.google.com/search?q=sol+lewitt&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnMOGrbPkAhWFlp4KHc0RA9gQ_AUIESgB&biw=1280&bih=677)

Conceptual art—the idea is what is the important aspect; or maybe the tension between idea and execution.

These are pieces by Sol Lewitt, who is a major figure in the so-called Western canon. But here's the thing. Sol didn't actually paint these. He just provided the [instructions](lewitt.pdf).

Lewitt was doing this in the 60s. What else was happening in the 60s? Well, computers, which had been invented in the modern sense in the 40s in the context of war-making, were diffusion of computation into the cultural consciousness. Today it's hard to separate out what a computer has touched because they are so integrated into everyday life. But at that point, you had these systems first emerging. And that's what artists do—they respond to the cultural conditions around them, interpret them, critique them, provide alternatives, and end up influencing the development. And visual artists have in fact had an enormous influence on computation.

So yeah, this idea that we can make things happen in the world by defining them in a formal way and letting the results play out.

So let's give it a shot.


## Exercise

- Take the drawing you made
- Get an index card
- On the card I want you to write, in words, a series of instructions that, when 
- if it's a representational drawing, describe how to draw it, but don't say what it is.
...
- Now we're going to swap
- When you're done, put the original, the code, and the re-interpretation together
_student shows the reinterpretation_
- How did it feel to follow the instructions?
- How much was left up to interpretation?
_author shows the original_
- Would you approach the instructions differently now?


## Course

From here on out, we're going to continue to write **algorithms**, but they will be for a computer instead of a human. As humans, we intuitively rely on a common context to understand what is being said to us. Lacking this, a computer depends on us to use an unambiguous formal language that it knows how to interpret. That is what a programming language is. There are many programming languages out there, but in this course we are going to use Python from within the Processing Environment, which is a platform designed for artists.

The link to the syllabus is up on Moodle. When you click it, it will take you over to a platform called GitHub — this is a common platform used by coders to keep track of software as they develop it. We're not going to use GitHub for code in this class, but _I_ use it to work on the course materials. So I may change things over the course of the semester, but whatever is up on GitHub is the way to go. That includes the course schedule—you'll have to look at the syllabus to know the due dates for things, and it might change as we go.

That said, the structure of the course is really simple. In addition to **algorithm** are several other qualities associated with digital media, and in this course we'll deal with **coordinates**, **repetition**, **indeterminacy**,  **time**, **interface**, **nonlinearity**, and **emergence**. For each one of these, I'll introduce the structure, show some of the context within art history, explain how you program it in Python, and then you'll complete an artwork (or as we'll call it, a "sketch").

And that is it in a nutshell. The only additional component is that once over the course of the semester, each one of you will give a short presentation about a digital media artist. The idea there is that we get a sense of some of the breadth of practices that are out there. We'll have a couple of those each week, and it may or may not line up with what we're working on that week, but that's ok. You can sign up for presentations via Moodle, it's first come first served, so check that out.

Also, please look at the syllabus in particular for policies, how the grading works, and so forth. The one really important thing to mention is there is no late work in this course — you submit things before class, we all look at the results together, and then that's it. 


## Finish

What questions do you have for me now?

So for the remainder of this time, we're going to try and get up and running.
