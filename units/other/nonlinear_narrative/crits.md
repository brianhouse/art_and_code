- Make a google folder with edit permissions shared with the link.
- Everyone uploads their python file with their name in the filename
- For desk crits, students just download the files of their tablemates and give direct feedback
- For final crit, there's a massive Google Doc in the folder with everyone's names. Everyone downloads four others and leaves notes--they should sign the notes.
/
- For intermediate desk crits, have them do this (without the doc) so they know the procedure
