## Sketch #7: Recursion

For this sketch, you will design one or more recursive algorithms. Your code may be shortâ€”a rich aesthetic outcome produced by simple procedures is what you should aim for. You may make use of base cases, random conditionals, multiple branches, and other techniques, but the only strict requirement is a function that calls itself.

Submit your code along with a [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md). Additionally, include an image produced from your sketch that you think is the most interesting or best represents your intention (choosing one of many outputs produced by the computer is a part of the artistic process).
