## Sketch #5: Nonlinearity

Create a nonlinear narrative using code where the path can be chosen by clicking on the canvas. It must include at least 8 different branching points that create meaningful alternative paths. While your work may be structurally similar to _Myst_, _Zork_, or other works of art or entertainment, the theme and content should reflect your own artistic concept. 

Approaches you might take:
- hypertext: use all text with highlighted words that lead to other sections
- image-only: use hotspots on images to simulate a 3D environment
- combination: use images to illustrate your world, but provide dialog and options via text
- cardinal directions: have a symbolic interface for moving around
- something else

If you use images, you can use images that you draw yourself in another program, images you steal online, or photos of the real world.

Draw a flowchart of the available choices (by hand, using Google Draw, or any other medium). Every state/room in your flowchart should correspond to a function in your code. Turn this in along with your code, which should include your title and a [3-sentence statement](../../resources/statement_guidelines.md) that conveys your concept.
