# Nonlinearity

## Concept

Traditional media such as film, audio recordings, or books typically proceed in a fixed sequence. Though we can do things like rewind a tape, or use page numbers to jump to a particular section of a novel, ultimately the possibilities are limited because the content is static. When creating artwork in these media, we typically compose a linear narrative (or narratives) that will be followed again and again in the same order.

Digital media, however, do not need to be linear. Because computers can respond in the moment to how a person is experiencing an artwork, the content can be dynamic. Rather than define the exact sequence of a story, for example, we can create a map of possibilities and leave the specific path up to the reader. This quality of nonlinearity is characteristic of narrative- and time-based artwork that does not just reproduce analog forms in digital media, but takes advantage of the possibilities intrinsic to computers.


## Context

### Non-digital

There are some ways analog media can have nonlinear structures without using computers. A classic example of this is the [_Choose Your Own Adventure_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) series of young adult novels. Popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the books are written in the [second person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration#Second-person) so that the reader identifies with the protagonist of the story. Every few pages, these books offer a choice between a few different actions, each of which requires skipping to a different page to continue reading. _Choose Your Own Adventure_ books had up to 44 different endings and prefigured some of the adventure games released on personal computers that were beginning to proliferate around the same time.

Julio Cortázar's [_Rayuela_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_(Cortázar_novel)) (1963, English: "Hopscotch") is another example from literature in which the reader may choose the order in which to experience the narrative by skipping chapters. Other works such as Jorge Borges' [_The Garden of Forking Paths_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths) (1941, [full text](https://archive.org/stream/TheGardenOfForkingPathsJorgeLuisBorges1941/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941_djvu.txt)),  Kurt Vonnegut's [_Slaughterhouse Five_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five) (1969) and Octavia Butler's [_Kindred_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel)) (1979) have narratives that proceed non-chronologically and so hint at nonlinearity, although they do not incorporate decisions by the reader into the text itself.

In 1967, Czech director Radúz Činčera tried something similar to _Choose Your Own Adventure_ with film. His [_Kinoautomat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoautomat), made for the Czechoslovak Pavilion of the World Exposition, included several points in which the action stopped and the audience was polled to determine what should happen next. The projection was switched between two reels of film accordingly. Although it caused a sensation, the film was banned by the Communist Party, which prevented its further development.

Although traditional film projection is inflexible in its sequence, just like in literature there are many movies that suggest nonlinearity in their content by telling a story in a different order than that experienced by the characters. These include several by celebrated avant-garde directors such as Akira Kurosawa's [_Rashomon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon) (Japanese, 1950 [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCZ9TguVOIA)), Jean-Luc Godard's [_Weekend_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_(1967_film)) (French, 1967 [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFJLuhVvBPM)), Andrei Tartovsky's [_The Mirror_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_(1975_film)) (Russian, 1975 [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXYfRkuA3cM)), and Quentin Tarantino's [_Pulp Fiction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction_(film)) (American, 1994 [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7EdQ4FqbhY)).

### Digital

In 1975, Will Crowther was working as a programmer on the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), a precursor to the internet funded by the US Department of Defense. Alongside his wife, Patricia, he had also been an avid caver. In an effort to bond with his young daughters after their divorce, Crowther combined his interests by programming a digital version of Kentucky's Mammoth Cave for the mainframe computers at his workplace (read more about this history in an [article](https://onezero.medium.com/the-woman-who-inspired-one-of-the-first-hit-video-games-by-mapping-the-worlds-longest-cave-ef572ccde6d2) by Claire Evans).

The result was [_Colossal Cave Adventure_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure), one of the earliest "games" made for computers and the first example of what became known "interactive fiction." Computer graphics were not yet widespread, and so _Adventure_ consists only of text. To explore the cave, the player types in one- or two-word commands to move and interact with objects. The program acts as a narrator, describing what is visible to the player and the results of their actions.

_Adventure_ subsequently became a touchstone of nerd and hacker culture, and together with its immediate successors such as [_Zork_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) (play [here](https://playclassic.games/games/adventure-dos-games-online/play-zork-great-underground-empire-online/play), original 1977 sourcecode [here](https://github.com/MITDDC/zork), cheats [here](http://www.eristic.net/games/infocom/zork1.html)), were highly influential on the development of later computer games, online role-playing, and today's virtual spaces.

Contemporary artists also began taking advantage of the possibilities for nonlinearity offered by digital media. Lynn Hershman Leeson's [_LORNA_](https://zkm.de/en/media/video/lynn-hershman-leeson-lorna-1979) (1979) is a preeminent example. Visitors to the gallery encounter a woman on a TV screen, and using the remote control, they navigate through her psychology to one of several possible results.

Online, websites and links provide another form of nonlinearity. Shortly after the World Wide Web and HTML browsers became widespread in the mid 1990s, artist Olia Lialina used basic HTML elements to create the poetic experience that is [_My Boyfriend Came Back from the War_](https://anthology.rhizome.org/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war) (1996, still online [here](http://www.teleportacia.org/war/)).

</p>

More recently, Netflix created a special episode of the dystopian series Black Mirror, called [_Bandersnatch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch) (2018), which incorporates audience choice into the narrative. The storyline features early game developers, and it self-reflexively refers both to the branching narratives of video games and the hacker culture of the 1970s inspired by _Adventure_.
