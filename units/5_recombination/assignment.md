## Sketch #5: Recombination

Choose one or more source texts—newspaper articles, poems, books, lyrics, emails, manifestos, etc—and write a program that recombines its contents to create a new text. The way in which the text is transformed should have an artistic purpose, whether that is to critically comment on the content of your source, explore some formal property of its language, or elicit a particular mood in your audience.

Along with your code and [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md), you should supply an example of your program's output. Resist the urge to edit the output to smooth over rough edges; looking back, those often become the most interesting features.
