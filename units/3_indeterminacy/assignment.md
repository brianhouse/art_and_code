## Sketch #3: Indeterminacy

In this sketch, you will explore indeterminacy as a means of making visual art with code. Your result can be abstract or representational (or a combination of the two). Use shapes together with loops and the `random` function. Pay special attention to layering. Not all parameters should be random, and by being intentional about the ranges of numbers you choose, the random elements in the resulting images should have a sense of structure and composition.

In the spirit of generative art, turn in three versions of your piece produced by the same code (to do this, you will have to name "output.png" something different on each run).

Turn in your .pyde file as well as your three versions. In addition, include a document that includes your title and a [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md) that explains how you'd like us to approach the result.

<!--
### Examples

One approach that you might take is to look for inspiration in complex textures from natureâ€”can you use loops+random to make an abstract interpretation of, for example, a pond with ripples and vegetation? Clouds and a rainstorm? A forest? Fire? A swarm of insects?
