## Sketch #7: Recursion

For this sketch, you will create a "glitch" version of an image of your choice. Create a transformation of the original that is your own (not a copy of these examples) and which serves an aesthetic and conceptual purpose in relation to the original image.

Submit your code along with a [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md). Include the original image along with an image of your reimagined version.
