# Emergence


<!-- #### Simulation

Seeking and avoiding; adding, removing, re-positioning, and modifying agents. From these relatively simple building blocks, we can design micro-worlds with their own emergent behaviors. Note that the only time we use `random()` is to set the initial attributes of agents when they are created, yet their exact paths are entirely unpredictable. This makes our simulations examples of chaotic systems with a high sensitivity to initial conditions.

As humans, we are experts at making sense of complexity through narrative. Materially, what we have here are lots and lots of calculations updating the positions of circles. But it is almost impossible for us not to personify these circles as characters with particular drives. This is how video games work, of course, as well as animation in general.

When we personify, we impose all sorts of biases and expectations. This is what makes building a simulation an artistic exercise. In this example, I've reproduced a predator/prey dynamic that we might recognize from nature but which also might be a mischaracterization of what actually happens in the natural world. Simulations like this are necessarily reductions, and the parameters we choose will effect how people receive the result.

Part of the limits to simulation comes from the computational cost. What if we had 100 bees here? 1000? The code wouldn't change much at all. But if you try it, you'll notice your computer start to grind. This is really where supercomputers and cloud computation and quantum computing comes inâ€”the capacity to do complex simulation. But there is always a limit. -->
