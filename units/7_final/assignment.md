## Final Project

Create a Processing sketch that expresses your own artistic concept. Your piece should be in dialog with the discussions that we have had in the course while reflecting some aspect of your personal artistic agenda. Use the programming techniques that we have covered; rather than learning more ways to code, this assignment is about integrating what we know and going deeper into concept.


### Proposal

Your proposal should consist of:
- A preliminary 3-sentence description and title that expresses your concept
- How your concept relates to one or more units that we have covered (nonlinearity, glitch, etc)
- Your technical approach to realizing it and what the biggest coding challenge will be


### Final

Submit your code along with your final [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md) as well as an image, text, or screen recording that documents the outcome.
